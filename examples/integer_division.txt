MOV R0, #7 ; Number to divide
MOV R1, #2 ; Divisor
MOV R2, #0 ; Count of number of multiples go in
loop:
    SUB R0, R0, R1 ; Subtract divisor from number to divide
    ADD R2, R2, #1 ; Add 1 to number of times divisor fits into number
    CMP R0, R1 ; Compare divisor to remaining value of number
    BLT end ; Branch to end if divisor is greater than remaining number value
    B loop ; Branch back to start of subtraction loop
end:
    STR R2, 1 ; Store result of division in memory location 1
    STR R0, 2 ; Store the remainder in memory location 2
    HALT ; Terminate program
